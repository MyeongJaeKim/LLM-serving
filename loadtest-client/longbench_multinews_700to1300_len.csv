"Passage 1: Soldiers and rescue workers flat at the site where a ferry sank in a reservoir in Guatape, Colombia, Sunday, June 25, 2017. Nine people were dead and 28 missing after a tourist ferry packed with around... (Associated Press)     GUATAPE, Colombia (AP) — A tourist boat packed with about 170 passengers for the holiday weekend capsized Sunday on a reservoir near the Colombian city of Medellin, leaving nine people dead and 28 missing, officials said.     Rescuers including firefighters from nearby cities and air force pilots were searching for survivors at the Guatape reservoir where the four-story El Almirante ferry sank. A flotilla of recreational boats and jet skis rushed to the scene, pulling people from the boat as it went down and avoiding an even deadlier tragedy.     Dramatic videos circulating on social media show the turquoise and yellow trimmed party boat rocking back and forth as people crawled down from a fourth-floor roof as it began sinking into the water.     ""Those on the first and second floors sank immediately,"" a female survivor who wasn't identified by name told Teleantioquia. ""The boat was sinking and all we could do was scream and call for help.""     Margarita Moncada, the head of the disaster response agency in Antioquia state, said that according to a preliminary report 99 people were rescued and another 40 managed to find a way to shore on their own and were in good condition. Speaking to reporters from the reservoir, she said nine people had been killed and around 28 are still missing.     It's unclear what caused the boat to sink but survivors said that it appeared to be overloaded and nobody on board was wearing a life vest.     Daniel Giraldo, owner of an Italian restaurant in Guatape, said he went to the bay after hearing the sound of ambulances. When he got to the shore people told him the ship had gone under.     ""It sank in a matter of four minutes,"" he said.     Next he went to the hospital where he said he saw a baby girl in a wet dress who had been saved but whose mother he was told is missing.     Authorities were at a loss to say exactly how many people were on the boat and asked passengers or their loved ones to report to a rescue center hastily set up along the shore. They also made a call for scuba divers to assist with the search.     The reservoir surrounding the soaring rocky outcrop of El Penol is a popular weekend destination a little more than an hour from Medellin. It was especially busy Sunday as Colombians celebrated a long holiday weekend.     --     AP Writers Christine Armario from Bogota, Colombia and Joshua Goodman from Caracas, Venezuela contributed to this report Passage 2: Rating is available when the video has been rented.

"Passage 1: Cigarette price hike risks black market - PM     By Adam Ray     The Prime Minister says a huge hike in the cost of cigarettes could encourage a black market for smokers.     3 News revealed yesterday that Health Ministry officials think cigarettes need to cost $100 a packet to make New Zealand smoke-free.     But Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia says she has a whatever-it-takes attitude to the idea.     Felix Five would love to quit, but struggles because he's addicted. He says pumping up the cost of cigarettes won't stop smokers.     “People still use heroin,” says the smoker. “It is expensive, cocaine is expensive. So I don't think people will stop smoking.”     A Health Ministry paper obtained by 3 News says drastic measures are needed to meet the Government's aim for New Zealand to be smoke-free by 2025.     One proposal is for prices to increase by around a third every year to reach $100 a packet within eight years.     But officials said one shock increase followed by smaller increases is more reasonable.     John Key says the Government is looking at a range of policies to stop smoking and huge price hikes could fuel black market trading.     “Whether that would be sustainable in terms of the black market, I don't know,” says John Key. “It seems like a big step.”     The Health Ministry says the discussion paper may be used to give advice to Government.     3 News asked Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia if she supported the idea of making cigarettes $100 a packet.     She gave a simple answer: whatever it takes.     3 News Passage 2: Pack Of Cigarettes 'May Rise To $100' In NZ     The price of a packet of cigarettes is set to rise significantly as New Zealand looks to stamp out smoking     The cost of a packet of cigarettes in New Zealand could rise to as much as $100 dollars - around £50 - by 2020 amid moves to stamp out smoking.     The Ministry of Health wants New Zealand to be smoke free by 2025 and the suggested increase gives the first hint of the drastic measures being discussed.     A document released under the Official Information Act to the country's 3 News website features a number of pricing scenarios - with the most extreme showing a single cigarette costing the equivalent of £2.50.     One option being considered is a 10% increase on a pack of 20 cigarettes year-on-year from 2013 to 2025, meaning it would cost $40 (£20) a pack by 2024.     But a second scenario would see packs at $100 each by 2020, achieved by an immediate shock rise of 30% to 60%, with on-going increases of 30% each year after that.     New Zealand aims to be smoke free by 2025     This model would reach the 2025 target to stamp out smoking completely, but is described in the paper as ""probably unrealistic"".     The most likely model would see a shock tax increase next year, and then a 10%-a-year rise, which would mean a packet of cigarettes costs around $60 (£30) by 2025.     Other ideas discussed in the document include regulating tobacco as a highly toxic substance, a ban on smoking in cars with children, a doubling of anti-smoking media campaigns and removing tobacco from duty-free sale.     The briefing paper said: ""If we are to continue to lower smoking prevalence we need to both increase the numbers who successfully quit smoking, and reduce smoking initiation among young people.     ""Tobacco taxation is the single most effective intervention available to drive down smoking prevalence figures.""     The Ministry of Health has said that the paper is an internal policy discussion and does not represent Government policy. ",765
"Passage 1: Ben Affleck took to his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon to share that he had been in rehab.     The actor said he'd completed treatment for alcohol addiction, which was the ""first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.""     He mentioned his family and three kids several times in the short statement and talked about his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, as his ""co-parent."" The 44-year-old said Garner has ""supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do.""     The star and producer in the upcoming The Batman movie noted that he's dealt with addiction in the past and that it's an issue he ""will continue to confront."" He also went to rehab in 2001 for alcohol abuse. Passage 2: Ben Affleck Completes Rehab     Ben Affleck Completes Rehab     Breaking News     Ben Affleck announced he's just completed a stint in rehab.     Sources tell us he was at a facility almost immediately after the Oscars 2 weeks ago.     Ben says he took it upon himself to get help because he had renewed problems with alcohol abuse. A source familiar with the situation says the problem has been going on ""a long time.""     It's not Ben's first time in rehab. He went to Promises in Malibu back in 2001 for alcohol abuse.     There have been reports he was reconciling with Jennifer Garner and she was dropping the divorce, but our sources say that is not true.     Ben says, ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I've set out to do."" Passage 3: Ben Affleck revealed, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, that he recently completed a stint in rehab for alcohol addiction.     “I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I’ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront,” he wrote on Facebook. Affleck checked himself into rehab in 2001 as well.     “I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step,” he continued. “I’m lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I’ve done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.”     In the Facebook post, Affleck said he’s “lucky to have the love of … co-parent, Jen.” He and wife Jennifer Garner separated in 2015, but have not formally divorced yet. The two have three children together: two daughters and one son. Affleck recently exited as director of the Batman standalone film, but will still star in and produce the highly-anticipated superhero tentpole. Matt Reeves has since taken over directing duties.     Affleck’s last directorial effort, the gangster pic “Live by Night,” flopped, leaving Warner Bros. — the studio behind the period film — with a $75 million loss.     Syfy also recently canceled the sci-fi thriller “Incorporated,” which Affleck executive produced with longtime friend and business partner Matt Damon and Jennifer Todd.

"Passage 1: CLOSE Discover what made the Angry Birds so angry at the pigs in 'The Angry Birds Movie.' USA TODAY     Red (Jason Sudeikis) leads the charge against the pig invaders in ""The Angry Birds Movie."" (Photo: Rovio Animation)     Furious fowl ruled the roost at the weekend box office.     Moviegoers flocked to see The Angry Birds Movie, which took flight with $39 million and No. 1, according to studio estimates from comScore. The family comedy — an adaptation of the popular app game — scored the third-best animated debut of the year, behind Zootopia ($75.1 million) and Kung Fu Panda 3 ($41.3 million). It was enough to knock Captain America: Civil War from its perch, which fell to No. 2.     Budgeted at $73 million, Angry Birds features the voices of Jason Sudeikis, Sean Penn, Maya Rudolph, Danny McBride and Josh Gad. Despite ruffling a few feathers among critics (whose reviews were only 42% positive on RottenTomatoes), audiences embraced it slightly more (61% liked it).     ""It's a rare bird,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. ""The video game aspect is drawing that audience that knows the brand, but then there's the crossover of family audiences who have really been drawn to PG-rated movies this year. This is a strong showing for the film,"" although the overall weekend box office is about 25% lower than it was this time last year, when Mad Max: Fury Road and Pitch Perfect 2 started on a high note.     Dropping to second place in its third week, Civil War muscled its way to $33.1 million, with a total of $347.4 million stateside and just over $1 billion worldwide. The superhero face-off starring Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. is now the seventh highest-grossing Marvel movie, performing slightly below last year's Avengers: Age of Ultron, which notched $372 million in its first three weeks and finished with $459 million in the USA.     Opening at No. 3, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising brought down the house with a solid, if not spectacular, $21.8 million. The R-rated comedy reunites Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as parents who team up with their former fratboy nemesis (Zac Efron) to take down hard-partying sorority sisters (led by Chloë Grace Moretz). With just OK reviews (61% positive), the film brought in less than half the business of its predecessor, which premiered with $49 million in May 2014 on its way to $150.2 million.     ""That was going to be a hard act to follow, no matter what,"" Dergarabedian says. ""R-rated comedies do so well in the summer because they're fresh and funny, but it's hard to replicate that. It's usually the original content from that genre that does well,"" calling to mind last year's Ted 2, which opened to nearly half ($33.5 million) of the 2012 original ($54.4 million).     Bringing up the rear, Shane Black's The Nice Guys was welcomed with a better-than-expected $11.3 million in fourth place. The 1970s noir comedy stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as mismatched detectives and has been embraced by critics (90% positive reviews) as well as moviegoers (84% liked it). Disney's live-action The Jungle Book rounded out the top five with $11 million in fifth, swinging to a wild $327.5 million since opening last month.     Final figures are expected Monday.

"Passage 1: All roads running through the Valley Forge National Historical Park were closed Tuesday after a sewer main break caused extensive flooding. Some reports estimated the volume of spilled raw sewage to be about 5 million gallons.     Tredyffrin Township officials said the break appeared to have occurred around 10:30 a.m. in a pipe section of the Valley Creek Trunk Sewer Force Main near the intersection of Routes 252 and 23 in Upper Merion Township.     The spill drew a multi-agency response that also included contractors and environmental and engineering consultants, according to authorities. Officials said in a release that repairing the main “will require extensive damage assessment and traffic control.”     An initial radio report indicated about 5 million gallons of raw sewage spilled into the Valley Creek. Neither township nor state officials immediately returned requests for comment Tuesday evening. Passage 2: Crews in Chester County are working to stop raw sewage from gushing out of a broken pipe into a creek at Valley Forge National Park. (Published Tuesday, Mar 18, 2014)     Crews worked through the night to repair a broken sewer main that sent 5,000 gallons of sewage per minute into the creek at the Valley Forge National Historical Park.     The break occurred in the Valley Creek Trunk Sewer Force Main Tuesday morning near the intersection of Routes 252 and 23 in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, Pa., according to township officials.     The 30-inch main is shared by Tredyffrin Township, Easttown Township, East Whiteland Township, Malvern Borough and Willistown Township.     Sewer Leak at Valley Forge Park     Water gushed onto the roadway at the intersection of Route 252 and Yellow Springs Road in Valley Forge Park causing traffic problems. (Published Tuesday, Mar 18, 2014)     Park rangers and police said water from the broken sewer main pushed through Route 23 in the park around 11 a.m. Tuesday and spilled off the side of the road.     Officials say the same main also broke six weeks ago, though they have not yet determined the cause of that break or the most recent one.     ""I don't want to speculate right now,"" said William Martin, a Tredyffrin Township worker. ""We've engaged other consultants to give us a long-term assessment of the pipe.""     Overnight crews removed the pipe. A new pipe is expected to arrive at the scene around 7 a.m. Wednesday.     ""We're working as fast as we can,"" Martin said. ""Really it's a time game to get the pipe back in the ground.""     The following roads that run through the park are closed:     Route 23 eastbound from Davis Road to Rt. 252     Route 23 westbound from N. Gulph Road to Rt. 252     Route 252 is closed northbound from the Pa. Turnpike     North and South Outer Line Drives     Gulph Road is closed from Thomas Road to Rt. 23     Yellow Springs Road is closed at the Covered Bridge     Public works officials expect these sections of road in the immediate area to be closed for several days as construction crews continue to repair the damaged water main and resurface portions of the street.     A PennDOT official told NBC10 that the broken main caused thousands of gallons of sewage per minute to leak into the Valley Creek, which feeds into the Schuylkill River. Officials say more than three million gallons of sewage may be in the creek.     Officials say the sewage leak doesn't pose a threat to humans but could be a safety concern for wildlife in the area.     NBC10 reached out to the Pa. Department of Environmental Protection asking how the leak could impact the surrounding area and the towns downriver, but officials have not responded to our calls. ",803

Passage 2: Ancient Tomb In Spain Destroyed And Replaced With A Picnic Table     Updated at 1:45 p.m. ET     The accidental destruction of an ancient tomb in northwest Spain was best summed up by an archaeologist in one perfect, if unintended, pun: ""monumental error.""     Workers in the town of Cristovo de Cea in the Galicia region mistook what is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Neolithic tomb for a broken stone picnic table and ""repaired it.""     Lauren Frayer reported from Spain for NPR's newscast:     ""An ancient tomb in northwest Spain had heritage status — and thus was supposed to be protected and clearly marked as an artifact. But somehow the local town council wasn't aware. So when parks and rec workers saw the granite slabs — they thought they were part of a park bench that needed repair. They poured concrete into the ancient burial chamber, and topped it with a brand new picnic table. An environmental group realized the error and complained. The tomb is believed to be more than 6,000 years old, from the area's ancient Celtic settlers.""     An investigation into how the tomb came to be destroyed is underway, according to The Local, but it appears to be an open and shut case: Officials simply weren't aware the site existed — not even the town's mayor, José Luis Valladores.     ""No one told me, neither Heritage nor the environmental group,"" he told the Spanish Huffington Post. ""The site wasn't even marked, and the logical thing would have been for them to get in contact with the local council so that we could have taken measures to protect the site,"" he added.     Juan Barceló, the archaeologist who called the mistake a monumental error, said he ""was horrified when he heard [the] news,"" and speculated that the breakdown in communication between builders and the local authorities was probably due to the summer holidays.     He also told The Local that mistakes like this are not the norm.     ""This is not representative of Spain, where monuments over 100 years old are all preserved by law,"" Barceló said. ""All authorities, national, state and local work effectively preserving our heritage. But sometimes accidents happen. I am sure that such disasters happen in many other countries, but have not been published.""     It turns out Barceló is partly right. Other countries have destroyed ancient remains, but usually it's done knowingly.     In 2007, as The New York Times reports, ""a work crew in the ancient capital city of Nanjing unearthed and destroyed the burial sites of 10 noblemen from six dynasties.""     Just last year, according to archaeologists, an ancient Native American burial ground and village in California was discovered and then razed in order to make way for multimillion-dollar homes.     However, the mistaken destruction of ancient relics isn't completely unheard of.     In 2013, NPR's Scott Neuman wrote about workers destroying a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid in Belize to use the rubble for road repair. They were apparently unaware that the pyramid was a Mayan ruin.     And then there are times when even the best intentions to preserve ancient relics go horribly awry, like this story from NPR's Eyder Peralta about a painter's attempt to restore a fresco. ",836

Prior to that, he served 13 years in the U.S. Air Force.     The murder victims have not been identified. Police had initially detained another man for questioning in the case but he was not arrested.     Cedar Hill ISD said Monday night Heath has been placed on administrative leave.

They discussed Stern's traumatic divorce from his ex-wife Alison, the wild period in his personal life that followed before he met his second wife Beth, former sidekick Artie Lange's suicide attempt, his many years in therapy and his plans for the next five years of his radio show.

(Norm Hall/Getty Images)     Tuesday brought news of a relatively small but noteworthy change being implemented by MLB this season: Intentional walks will now be granted to hitters with a signal from the opposing dugout, rather than by having the pitcher throw four obvious balls. While the baseball powers that be, such as Commissioner Rob Manfred, see the move as helping speed games up, not everyone is thrilled to see the four-pitch intentional walk go the way of the dodo.     [Analysis: Baseball kills off a part of history, and gains almost nothing]     For one thing, while it seems like the simplest of acts to lob four pitches to a catcher standing well away from the batter’s box, things can and do occasionally go awry, which is always fun. Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis pointed out on Twitter that he has twice scored on errant pitches during intentional walks, one of which was featured in a video posted by another Twitter user.     But I’ve scored twice on an overthrow during an intentional walk… https://t.co/cSHhsBQknY — Jason Kipnis (@TheJK_Kid) February 22, 2017     •The MLB has approved to change the intentional walk rule. Which now will be granted following dugout signal. Take a look at these classics. pic.twitter.com/g3iyEW5kB3 — Dylan (@DylansFreshTake) February 22, 2017     I'm kind of disappointed to see the intentional walk disappear if only because I loved to see it botched every now and then. — Baseball Joe Veyera (@JoeVeyera) February 22, 2017     The flip side of that scenario comes when a pitcher actually gets his lob a little too close to the strike zone and an intrepid batter goes for it. That’s fun, too!     As we say goodbye to the intentional walk(for now), I'd like to remind everyone of this absolute boss moment from Miggy. pic.twitter.com/KouH4Ixvew — Jason Ochart (@Jason_cOchart) February 22, 2017     @Tony_Frye I saw Will Clark single on an attempted intentional walk. It was awesome. Make them throw the dang pitches. — Susan Slusser (@susanslusser) February 22, 2017     Some online commenters made the case that the rule change will be so inconsequential, it’s hardly worth it.     Intentional walks took an estimated 1410 minutes in 2016.     That is 35 seconds per game. Is the automatic IBB really gonna fix pace of play? — MLB Statistics (@MLBRandomStats) February 22, 2017     932 intentional walks in 2,428 games last season. A baseball game is now, on average, 1.5 pitches shorter. — Ryan M. Spaeder (@theaceofspaeder) February 22, 2017     Others, not surprisingly, took things in a less serious direction.     I like the moment of the intentional walk especially late in the game. I want the guy on deck to have enough time to get properly offended. — Royals Nation (@RoyalsNation) February 22, 2017     Instead of cutting the intentional walk, make it more exciting! All intentional walks to be thrown by the center fielder, minimum 300 feet. — Jon Weisman (@jonweisman) February 21, 2017     But if the ol’ four-pitch IBB must go, can we at least have some fun with the dugout signal?

"Passage 1: Image copyright Antarctic Gurkha Image caption Scott Sears arrived at the South Pole on Christmas Day     Tennis star Andy Murray's brother-in-law believes he has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo.     Scott Sears, a lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, pulled a sled and supplies for 38 days through 150mph winds in temperatures of -50c.     His 702-mile trek ended at the South Pole on Christmas Day, more than 12 days sooner than he had anticipated.     The Guinness Book of Records has yet to confirm whether the 27-year-old's feat will make it into the record books.     Lt Sears, from east London, is the brother of Murray's wife, Kim.     From a family of tennis players, he played the sport on the international circuit until the age of 19. Several years later, he went on to join the Army.     'Not one more step'     The first part of the journey from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land in Antarctica is considered the most dangerous part, as the ground is riddled with crevasses.     Travelling alone meant Lt Sears was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him falling down them, and he used skis to cross the ice instead.     In a blog post from his five-week expedition, he described unexpectedly hitting a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day.     ""I couldn't have asked for better weather but well and truly hit a wall midway through the day,"" he wrote.     ""I've never experienced anything like it, I would take a couple of steps and just stop, everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step'.     ""It was bizarre as I've genuinely been feeling pretty good.""     But after some juice, biltong, chocolate and music on his iPod, he was back on his way.     That night, Lt Sears hung his socks up as makeshift stockings, but said he feared Santa might give them a miss because of the ""state and stench"" of them.     The following day, he reached the pole in blue skies, and wrote saying he was ""absolutely chuffed to pieces"".     He told the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that he expected it would take a few weeks for the experience to sink in.     ""I've been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks so it's all a bit overwhelming,"" he said.     ""I can't wait to have a shower and get some food in me. I've been dreaming about it since day three!""     Image copyright PA Image caption Scott Sears with his sister, Kim     Judy Murray, Andy's mother, congratulated him, tweeting: ""Well done Scott Sears - (brother of Andys wife Kim) youngest person to reach the South Pole on a solo mission. Got there on Christmas Day......""     Lt Sears has raised more than £33,500 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to help rebuild schools in Gorkha, Nepal, which was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. Passage 2: A serving British Army officer has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole on his own and unsupported, after trekking for more than five weeks.     Lt Scott Sears, the brother-in-law of Andy Murray, reached his destination on Christmas Day after negotiating 700 miles of Antarctic plateau, crevasse fields and glaciers.     The 27-year-old officer with 1st Bn Royal Gurkha Rifles raised over £30,000 for The Gurkha Welfare Trust and schools destroyed in the 2015 Nepal earthquake.     Waiting on Tuesday night for a plane to take him off the pole to Union Glacier, he said: “The last 5 weeks have been a huge challenge but I’m proud to be standing here now after 2 years of planning and training.     “It’s going to take a few weeks for everything to sink in, I’ve been alone in a tent for nearly 6 weeks so it’s all a bit overwhelming”.

"Passage 1: Credit: (left) UZH; (right) 120/Creative Commons     Europe's best-known mummy wasn't just a medical mess; he also had terrible teeth, according to a new study. Ötzi (inset photo), a Stone Age man who died atop a glacier about 5300 years ago, suffered from severe gum disease and cavities. His teeth, back and front, were also heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and use as a ""third hand"" for gripping tools and cutting. When Ötzi was discovered atop a glacier on the Austro-Italian border, his frozen corpse was intensively studied. But no one took a close look at his teeth until now. Using 3D computer tomography (a CAT scan), the hunter's mouth could be examined for clues as to the life he led. The results, published this week in the European Journal of Oral Sciences, suggest that Ötzi didn't have it easy. A fall or other accident killed one of his front teeth, still discolored millennia later. And he may have had a small stone, gone unnoticed in his whole-grain bread or gruel, to thank for a broken molar. That gruel may be the culprit behind Ötzi's cavities and gum disease, too. (An arrow on the right in CAT scan above marks places where the bone is eaten away by infection, the left arrow points at deep cavities.) In the late Stone Age, humans were increasingly incorporating coarsely ground grain into their diets. The uptick in starches, the researchers suggest, could explain the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time—a problem that's been with us ever since.         See more ScienceShots. Passage 2: Few of our ancestors have been so thoroughly poked and prodded as Neolithic Tyrolean Iceman ""Ötzi,"" discovered melting out of an Alpine glacier in 1991. Researchers have probed his stomach and bowels for traces of his last meal and analyzed his teeth for cavities. Now, an international team has sequenced his entire genome, and it turns out Ötzi still has some surprises in store.     Earlier computer scans had revealed Ötzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. But the new analysis shows that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to the condition, despite the fact that as a hunter-gatherer he had none of what are currently believed to be the relevant risk factors, such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. ""This new data suggests that we might be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we believed,"" notes cardiologist and mummy expert Gregory Thomas of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the new work.     The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about Ötzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed Ötzi's mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his Y chromosome places him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era, roughly 1000 years before Ötzi himself lived.     Ötzi's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia, says geneticist Angela Graefen of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy, one of the principal researchers on the paper. That doesn't mean that Ötzi was Sardinian or Corsican, Graefen notes, but that those populations may be the closest living genetic matches to the hunter-gatherers who originally migrated into Europe.     The genome analysis, published this week in Nature Communications, also helps flesh out our picture of Ötzi the man: Researchers now know he had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease: the sequencing yielded genes from the disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Although scientists can't know whether Lyme disease actually made Ötzi sick during his lifetime, the discovery of 60% of a B. burgdorferi genome from a Neolithic carrier shows that this pathogen has plagued humans for thousands of years. Until researchers compare the B. burgdorferi genome from Ötzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen, they won't have a clear picture of how Lyme disease evolves. ""But depending on the research other scientists are doing over the next few years, we could be gaining a lot more insights from Ötzi's genome,"" Graefen says.     The new paper adds to our knowledge of Neolithic life, says mummy expert Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. ""Of course Ötzi is only one individual, but he's a very well-preserved, well-described individual, whom we have a lot of additional information about already. So this is an important step."" ",978
"Passage 1: MEXICO CITY (AP) — A species of snake that had been ""lost"" for almost 80 years has been re-discovered on a remote Mexican island.     According to a study published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, the Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast.     The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar.     Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error and the snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries.     But Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it.     Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, noted the islands change a lot from season to season, so they timed the expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps as they looked for the snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations and is largely active at night. And they used Beebe's original field notes as a guide.     ""Basically, following those directions, we essentially put ourselves in his place,"" Martinez Gomez said.     One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936.     The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Martinez Gomez said the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.     The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy ""uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.""     Patricia Escalante, a biologist who curates bird collections at Mexico's National Autonomous University and who was not involved in the snake project, said the re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake was ""very interesting"" and significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems.     One inhabitant of the Revillagigedo Islands, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s. But live specimens had been taken off the islands in the 1920s, and their descendants were recently re-introduced to the islands. Passage 2: Image copyright Daniel Mulcahy Image caption The Clarion Nightsnake has a distinctive pattern of spots Photo: Daniel Mulcahy     A lost species of snake that eluded scientists for nearly 80 years has been rediscovered in Mexico, a US museum says.     The Clarion Nightsnake was found on the Pacific island of Clarion in Mexico by a researcher from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.     The snake was first discovered in 1936 by naturalist William Beebe.     Although never declared extinct, it was struck from the record after scientists were unable to rediscover it.     The museum said that researcher Daniel Mulcahy, working with an expert from a Mexican institute, carried out an expedition to Clarion Island where their team identified 11 snakes matching Beebe's description.     DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake was indeed genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico.     The museum said the snake species is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts. It is now recognised as a full species.     ""The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,"" Mr Mulcahy said in a museum statement.     ""Proper identification is the first step toward conserving this snake, and we plan to continue monitoring this species to learn more about the role it plays in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem.""

"Passage 1: McDonald’s should probably think about giving one of its Florida cashiers a raise.     On Tuesday morning, Pedro Viloria, a worker who mans the drive-thru, jumped through the ordering window at a McDonald’s in Doral, Fla., to help a woman who suddenly became unconscious while operating her vehicle.     Viloria was stationed at his post behind the drive-thru window when a woman — who turned out to be an off-duty Miami-Dade police officer —pulled up in an SUV to order breakfast for herself and her two children. After preparing the order, Viloria returned to the window and noticed that the driver was struggling to breathe.     MCDONALD'S BLASTED OVER 'INSULTING' SHAMROCK SHAKE TWEET     Soon after, the woman lost consciousness, her foot slipped from the brake, and her SUV began to roll down the drive-thru lane.     Viloria, who witnessed the woman falling unconscious, says he immediately went into “hero mode” and jumped through the restaurant’s drive-thru window. Surveillance footage also shows Viloria pulling the off-duty officer from the SUV as it rolled forward.     A second McDonald’s employee, along with paramedics who were in the restaurant, helped to revive the woman at the scene. She was then taken to the hospital for additional treament.     A representative for McDonald’s has since released a statement on the incident in which they commend Viloria’s bravery, reports Fox 5 NY.     “First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the officer and her family during this difficult time,” McDonald’s wrote. “I think I speak for our McDonald’s family when I say how proud we are of Pedro. He is an excellent employee, so it didn’t surprise me that he took immediate action and jumped through a window to help save this woman.

A second employee, who asked to remain unnamed, assisted with CPR. Their quick thinking and action were everything in that moment.”     As of Wednesday, Miami-Dade Police Detective Daniel Ferrin has yet to release any information on the woman’s condition.     The Associated Press contributed to this report. Passage 2: Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter     MIAMI (CBSMiami) – A McDonald’s employee jumped right through a drive-thru window in order to help save a Miami-Dade police officer.     “I thought, ‘If those kids lose their mother today, that’s going to be tragic,’” said Pedro Viloria.     Viloria was working the window at the McDonald’s on 113th Avenue in Doral early Tuesday morning.     He was serving breakfast to a lady in an SUV along with her children, a boy and a girl.     Viloria noticed something wrong with the mother, so did the kids.     “Her kids were screaming, ‘Mother, mother, stop it, mother what are you doing?’” Viloria recalled.     On surveillance camera you can see the SUV start to move. Apparently the women’s foot was off the brake.     Viloria knew he had to make a move, so he hopped out the service window in pursuit of the SUV and the stricken driver. He did it just as the SUV came to a stop up against the driveway curb.     Viloria said he told the kids to call 911 right away.     The kids did just that as a firefighter walked into the McDonald’s.     The firefighter was unaware of what was happening, but soon enough he headed out knowing something was up. He and his partner rushed to help, so did an off-duty paramedic.     Within what seemed like seconds, fire rescue was on the scene.     “I was with the kids telling them it was going to be all right,” Viloria said.     McDonald’s released a statement applauding Viloria’s actions.     “First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the officer and her family during this difficult time. I think I speak for our McDonald’s family when I say how proud we are of Pedro.

During that time, Clemmons says she “avoided those people like the plague because of their racism,” adding, “I’d call their strain ‘hipster-racism,’ which typically uses sarcasm as a cover.” She cites her relationship with her editors as the reason she has stayed at Lenny until now, but says that Dunham’s reaction to the accusations made by Perrineau pushed her to leave the newsletter. “As a result of Lena Dunham’s statements, I have decided that I will no longer write for Lenny Letter.

Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter?

Because let’s take a step back, says Clemmons. She’s currently in Nigeria at a literary festival hearing stories from women who are “putting themselves in danger every day to help women in some of the worst conditions on earth.” She reminds us to consider the 26 Nigerian girls who drowned last week while being sex trafficked off the coast of Italy.     With that in mind, here’s what she has to say about Dunham:     Jemima Kirke was in my year at RISD while I was at Brown [Ed note: the campus is next door]. We had many mutual acquaintances and still do. Most of these acquaintances were like Lena–wealthy, with parents who are influential in the art world. They had a lot of power and seemed to get off on simultaneously wielding it and denying it. Back in college, I avoided these people like the plague because of their well-known racism. I’d call their strain “hipster racism”, which typically uses sarcasm as a cover, and in the end, it looks a lot like gaslighting– “It’s just a joke. Why are you overreacting?” is a common response to a lot of these statements. In Lena’s circle, there was a girl who was known to use the N word in conversation in order to be provocative, and if she was ever called on it, she would say “it’s just a joke.”     Advertisement     Clemmons adds that she was “horrified” to hear Aurora Perrineau’s accusation of sexual assault by Girls writer Murray Miller–which Dunham baselessly rejected–because it mirrored an assault a friend of hers experienced at the hands of another member of Lena’s circle. “I grew up middle class, with no family connections in the writing or art worlds, and my friend was from a similar background. We were powerless against them.”     Her takeaway is sobering and obvious but invariably, relentlessly upstaged.         Thank you. This is grounding. ",1013
"Passage 1: But to many across the country and even here in Portland, it's best known as the bookstore Women and Women First from IFC's Portlandia. For six seasons of the show, In Other Words has allowed Portlandia to film the saga of feminist bookstore owners Toni and Candace, played by Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen. Passage 2: Several months ago the In Other Words community agreed to discontinue our relationship with Portlandia. This was a direct response to a particular egregious filming of the show in our space which saw our store left a mess, our staff mistreated, our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning, and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed. It was also a direct response to a show which is in every way diametrically opposed to our politics and the vision of society we’re organizing to realize. A show which has had a net negative effect on our neighborhood and the city of Portland as a whole. Shortly after this decision was made, a volunteer placed the Fuck Portlandia sign in our window.     Being on Portlandia Doesn’t Make Us Money     We are paid a small flat fee per episode filmed at in Other Words. This fee does not cover the profits lost by our having to remain closed for filming. It also does not cover the additional business lost by our neighbors who at times also have to remain closed for filming. The additional exposure we have received from our time on Portlandia does not provide financial or political support of any kind: tourists and fans of the show come to our door to stand outside, take selfies, and then leave. The vast majority of them don’t come inside.     The Show is Bad     The Women and Women First segments that are filmed at In Other Words are trans-antagonistic and trans-misogynist and have only become more offensive as the show goes on. ‘LOL Fred Armisen in a wig and a dress’ is a deeply shitty joke whose sole punchline throws trans femmes under the bus by holding up their gender presentation for mockery and ridicule. In a world where trans femmes – particularly Black trans women – are being brutalized and murdered on a regular basis for simply daring to exist, dude in a dress jokes are lazy, reactionary, and actively harmful. They’re also just straight up not funny.     Also: there are no Black people on Portlandia. There are a tiny number of people of color on Portlandia. Portland is white but it’s not that damn white. It’s also a city with a deeply entrenched history of racism and white supremacy. In Other Words is in the heart of a historically Black neighborhood in Northeast Portland. We have Black Lives Matter written on our window. Black Lives Matter Portland meets regularly in our space. But as more and more Black folks and people of color have become involved at In Other Words, Portlandia has only gotten steadfastly more white. Oh and also: the last time the show filmed in our space, the production crew asked to us to remove the Black Lives Matter sign on our window. We refused.     Gentrification Isn’t a Joke     Portlandia is fueling mass displacement in Portland. Fred and Carrie are on billboards and realtors have gleefully begun using Portlandia’s popularity and insipid humor (‘put a bird on it!’) to make displacing the communities that made Portland a great place in the first place something twee and whimsical for the incoming technocrat hordes.     The current board, staff, and volunteers were not involved in the decision, made six years ago, to allow Portlandia to film at In Other Words. We stand behind our collective decision to discontinue our relationship with the show. And we fucking love the sign.     Support our stance?

"Passage 1: Ursula Coyote for Netflix Hackers could be selling lifetime access to your Netflix subscription for just $0.50.     A recent report by McAfee Labs revealed you can buy access to ""many online streaming entertainment"" services, like Netflix and Spotify, in Dark Web marketplaces. These marketplaces can be accessed only by using a special internet browser called TOR that hides your IP address.     According to McAfee Labs, stolen HBO NOW and HBO GO accounts, as well as other cable streaming services, can be bought for less than $10. Premium pro sports services will run you about $15.     Do the accounts work?     You might assume that if you buy access to someone else's Netflix account, it will get shut down fairly quickly, but this is not necessarily the case.     Raj Samani, the CTO of Intel Security, told Tech Insider that these marketplaces are highly competitive for sellers, and some provide a ""guarantee"" you'll have a lifetime subscription.     ""I don't want to call it a risk-free transaction but they try to make it as risk-free as they possibly can,"" Samani told Tech Insider. He says one marketplace actually has its own help desk.

""We found pretty much everything possible available for sale,"" Raj Samani, the vice president and CTO at Intel Security, who last month wrote a report on the Dark Web, told Tech Insider in an interview. ""Every possible service and every possible flavor you could think of was being made for sale.""     Indeed, a recent visit to one of these marketplace on the Dark Web by Tech Insider found that he could easily buy lifetime subscriptions to Spotify and Netflix for a fraction of the price of a monthly subscription.     What's remarkable about this is that buying legitimate subscriptions to these services is both easy and relatively inexpensive, yet a marketplace still exists for these.     A lifetime subscription to Spotify is only $1.95. Screenshot/Tech Insider Samani said that these accounts are likely based on both stolen credit card data as well as stolen account information.     Here's a lifetime subscription to Netflix for just $0.50:     Screenshot/Tech Insider It's highly competitive for these sellers, and many are somehow able to guarantee that you'll have lifetime access to these services, even if there are issues with that original account you buy. That is, the sellers say they'll give you working account information if the account credentials you buy are shut down.     ""It's remarkable,"" Samani said. This marketplace ""actually has its own help desk.""     ""I don't want to call it a risk-free transaction but they try to make it as risk free as they possibly can,"" he said.     As Samani outlined in his report last month, having one of your own accounts end up on a Dark Web marketplace could be a huge headache. The account could be closed because of malicious activity, and you may have to endure hours on the phone with technical support.     That's why it's important to keep your own data safe. Use unique, strong passwords for all of your services, and use two-factor authentication whenever possible. Two-factor authentications requires people to have a second form of credentials, like a code from a text message, when they login to an account.     In this outtake from our Codebreaker podcast, former US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff tells host Ben Johnson what scares him about the dark web:     The Dark Web: Is it evil? Listen to the whole episode to find out.     Samani also recommends taking proactive steps, like using a credit monitoring service, to stay vigilant.     ""Just be really conscious about who you're sharing your data with,"" he said.     The Dark Web is the subject of the latest episode of Marketplace and Tech Insider's new Codebreaker podcast.

"Passage 1: A rat infestation closed down a government office in Kissimmee that was storing donations destined for Puerto Rico, contaminating boxes of supplies that were never sent to the island.     The office of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration “does not have the budget to finance the shipping costs” of the supplies, according to PRFAA’s executive director Carlos Mercader. He added that previous efforts to send the boxes of water, food and other supplies through other organizations “have been unsuccessful.”     Mercader could not say how many boxes were on the property, but the island’s regional office had collected the items in Hurricane Maria’s aftermath, from local organizations and private individuals.     “Due to the many Puerto Rican families that have been displaced to Florida because of the hurricane, we have donated the meals to Puerto Rican families in need,” Mercader said Tuesday in a statement. “We will soon conduct an inventory of the donations to identify which ones are fit to be given out to Puerto Rican evacuees in Central Florida.”     The office was previously infested by rodents on August 10, about a month before the storm devastated the island.     “The building where the office is located is deteriorated, aside from being old, which is why PRFAA has decided to move the office to a more appropriate and dignified space to continue offering the services to the public,” Mercader said.     The agency, which represents Puerto Rico through its Central Florida and Washington D.C. offices, promotes public policy issues related to the island and was created to support Puerto Ricans moving to the region. The Kissimmee office is currently managed by Mercader since the most recent director, Frances Ortiz, resigned last month.     Thousands of Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida after Hurricane Maria hit the island, many of whom are expected to stay in Central Florida. Last month, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló rallied members of the Puerto Rican community in the region and urged them use their political leverage against lawmakers who have voted against the island’s interests.     Juan Hernandez Mayoral, who directed the PRFAA office in Kissimmee from 2013 to 2017, said the news was “baffling.”     “Every day, those employees would go into that office and saw those boxes and they did nothing,” said Hernandez Mayoral, who is a former Puerto Rican senator and is affiliated with the island’s pro-commonwealth party. “As if there was no need on the island. This is government negligence.”     Jennifer Marcial Ocasio contributed to this report.     bpadro@orlandosentinel.com or 407-232-0202.

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images     Mercader added that the office in Kissimmee, Florida, had deteriorated to such an extent that his administration had decided to move to a new building.     “Every day, those employees would go into that office and saw those boxes and they did nothing,” Hernandez Mayoral, who ran the Kissimmee headquarters from 2013 to 2014, said. “As if there was no need on the island. This is government negligence.""     The reports of the spoiled food come amid a litany of administrative failings with regard to aid sent to Puerto Rico.     U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings and Stacey Plaskett, the congressional delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands, have called for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be subpoenaed over its failure to provide tens of millions to Puerto Rico.     The federal agency awarded a $156 million contract to a small Atlanta-based company called Tribute Contracting LLC. It delivered only 50,000 of the 30 million meals promised, CNN reported.     ""One of the primary reasons FEMA failed to deliver these meals is because it inexplicably awarded a contract worth approximately $156 million to deliver 30 million emergency meals to a tiny, one-person company with a history of struggling with much smaller contracts,"" Cummings and Plaskett said in the letter.     Contracting owner Tiffany Brown said Tuesday that she has been overwhelmed by the order and plans to sue the government for $70 million. ",1067
"Passage 1: Geneva (AFP) - Swiss authorities on Saturday said two Syrians had been arrested in Geneva after traces of explosives were found in their car, as police continued to hunt for several suspected jihadists with links to the Islamic State group.     Geneva prosecutor Olivier Jornot told a news conference that the two men had Syrian passports and only ""recently arrived"" in Switzerland. They spoke Arabic, he added.     They were arrested after police were alerted about ""their behaviour"".     He sidestepped questions on whether the pair were on visas allowing them to circulate freely through the visa-free Schengen zone.     But Jornot said they were not among the four men being searched as suspected jihadists planning attacks following the Paris carnage on November 13 and whose photographs have been released by the police.     Jornot said the two arrested men said they had recently bought the car they were travelling in and clarified that it only bore traces of explosives and not toxic gases.     View gallery Geneva's attorney general Olivier Jornot speaks during a press conference on December 12, 2015 ( …     He said they were arrested on the day they arrived in Switzerland.     The federal prosecutor's office had said in a statement earlier Saturday that the two men were arrested on suspicion of the ""manufacture, concealment and transport of explosives and toxic gases"" and of violating Swiss law prohibiting ""groups like Al-Qaeda, Islamic State and similar organisations"".     Jornot later clarified that ""the vehicle was at one point used to transport explosives"" but that it did not necessarily mean it was the two suspects who did so.     The arrests come with the city on edge after Swiss authorities on Thursday opened a probe relating to a ""terrorist threat in the Geneva region"", prompting the region to raise its alert level to three on a five-point scale.     Armed police were deployed at sensitive locations across Geneva, which borders France and is home to the United Nations' European headquarters.     The Le Temps daily on Friday cited an unnamed source close to the case as saying the Swiss had received a tip-off from US intelligence about a jihadist cell in Geneva.     Pictures of four individuals suspected of links to the Islamic State group, which claimed last month's Paris attacks, were published by media across the country.     Authorities in Geneva had said that the search for possible extremists was being conducted ""in the context of the investigation following the Paris attacks"".     But multiple sources, who requested anonymity, said there did not appear to be a direct link with the coordinated November 13 gun and suicide bombing attacks that left 130 dead in the French capital. Passage 2: Image copyright AFP Image caption With Geneva on high alert, the city's airport was evacuated after a suspect package was found     Two people of Syrian origin have been arrested in Geneva on suspicion of making, concealing and transporting explosives, the Swiss attorney general says.     The two are also suspected of violating a law prohibiting groups such as al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State (IS), the statement added.     Geneva's prosecutor said traces of explosive had been found in their car.     Geneva has been on high alert this week amid fears an IS cell was in the area.     Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said on Friday that a ""foreign authority"" had provided the information about ""a potential IS cell in the Geneva area"" but there was no indication that ""a concrete attack"" was planned.     Image copyright AP Image caption Checks have been increased on the French-Swiss border near Geneva     Image copyright AP Image caption Security was tightened outside France's consulate in Geneva     Geneva's Prosecutor Olivier Jornot told a news conference that the two Syrians had just arrived in the Swiss city and could not speak French when they were arrested on Friday.     They ""were stopped by Geneva police... because of the increased vigilance required from the police force,"" he said. ""These people, because of their behaviour and nationality, were subject to more careful checks, and these checks revealed traces of explosives in the car they were using.""     He confirmed no evidence of toxic gas was found.     An earlier statement from the prosecutor's office said criminal proceedings had been opened against them under Switzerland's law against the manufacture and transport of explosives and toxic gases.     The tip-off about a terror cell in Geneva had originally come from the United States, Swiss media reported on Friday.     Daily newspaper Le Temps, quoting a source close to the investigation, said US intelligence had identified three jihadist cells in Chicago, Toronto and Geneva.     On Thursday, security was stepped up outside synagogues, the UN building and the French ambassador's home, as well as train stations, the airport and similar places.     The number of police on Geneva's streets has been increased.     UN spokesman Michele Zaccheo said there was ""no specific threat to the UN in Geneva or its personnel"".     The border with France runs through the outskirts of Geneva.     IS said it carried out the attacks in Paris on 13 November which killed 130 people.     Two men linked to the attacks - Salah Abdeslam and Mohammed Abrini - are still on the run and investigations have been launched in several European countries. ",1111
"Passage 1: ""What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn't so different from a President really. I can enact positive change. I can actually help people. I can be a symbol of my democracy. I can refuse to call him President, and call out other abuses of power when I see them. I can vote for a President, in part, by the nature of his or her character, knowing that his or her political decisions must necessarily stem from that character."" Passage 2: UPDATED with new accusations from second actress: Following Lind’s accusation and a set of two apologies from Bush’s camp, another actress has come forward admitting that the former president touched her inappropriately.     Jordana Grolnick said in August 2016 while she was working on a production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in Maine, Bush came backstage during intermission and grabbed her as they posed for a picture.     She claims, “He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, ‘Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?’ As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, ‘David Cop-a-Feel!’”         EARLIER with second apology from George H.W. Bush: Since the accusations from Lind, former President George H.W. Bush has issued a second apology to the first.     According to The Washington Post spokesman, Jim McGrath, released a full statement on Wednesday:     At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.     EARLIER: Turn: Washington’s Spies actress Heather Lind has come forward with accusations that President George H.W. Bush sexually assaulted her during a photo opportunity with his wife Barbara Bush standing by his side. Bush has since apologized for the incident saying that it was an “attempt at humor” and that he didn’t mean to offend Lind.     Lind made the accusations through a lengthy Instagram post that has since been deleted. She recently saw a photo of the 93-year-old wheelchair bound Bush shaking hands with Barack Obama at the One America Appeal hurricane relief concert which prompted her to share her alleged experience saying, “…when I got the chance to meet George H. W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.”     The Instagram post continued saying that Bush touched her from behind and told her a dirty joke — all while being photographed. All the while Barbara Bush “rolled her eyes as if to say ‘Not again’.”     “It seems to me a President’s power is in his or her capacity to enact positive change, actually help people, and serve as a symbol of our democracy,” she continued. “He relinquished that power when he used it against me and, judging from the comments of those around him, countless other women before me. What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really.”     She closed the post saying, “My fellow cast-mates and producers helped me that day and continue to support me. I am grateful for the bravery of other women who have spoken up and written about their experiences. And I thank President Barack Obama for the gesture of respect he made toward George H. W. Bush for the sake of our country, but I do not respect him. #metoo.”     In a statement to the New York Daily News, Bush’s spokesperson said, “President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind”     Lind’s accusations come in the wake of the Weinstein scandal and the fallout of many film and TV executives due to sexual harassment allegations.     As mentioned in her now-deleted Instagram post, her colleagues have come forward to support her allegations. Turn co-star and Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally tweeted, “My full support for @heatherglind for speaking out about the horrible event in Houston. All of which is true.” This was followed by numerous tweets about sexual harassment.     Author of Washington Spies, the book on which Turn is based also tweeted saying, “@heatherglind & ex-Pres. Bush, her account is 100% accurate. I was there. It was not a ‘joke’ gone awry.” The official Turn account also chimed in, tweeting, “Sexual assault is always about abusing power over their victims. The fact that this has been politicized is avoiding the real issue.”     My full support for @heatherglind for speaking out about the horrible event in Houston. All of which is true. — Kevin McNally (@exkevinmcnally) October 25, 2017     Re: @heatherglind & ex-Pres. Bush, her account is 100% accurate. I was there.

(Associated Press)     The theme of her broadcast was especially poignant Sunday as Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, remained in hospital recovering from a heart procedure. The message was recorded Dec. 9, before he was hospitalized.     Wearing a festive red dress, the Queen said that the importance of family was driven home by the marriages of two of her grandchildren this year.     She spoke of the strength family can provide during times of hardship and how friendships are often formed in difficult times.     Elizabeth pointed to the Commonwealth nations as an example that family ""does not necessarily mean blood relatives but often a description of a community.""     THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.     LONDON (AP) _ Britain's royal family celebrated Christmas on Sunday with one notable absence _ Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip, who remains hospitalized following a heart procedure.     The 90-year-old prince was recovering from having a coronary stent put in after doctors determined the heart pains that sent him to the hospital on Friday were caused by a blocked artery.     Buckingham Palace said ""he's in good spirits"" and family members will visit Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, in the hospital after lunch.     The royal family's Christmas schedule kicked off with a traditional morning service at St. Mary Magdelene Church, on the queen's sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk.     The huge crowds that gathered outside the church got an early peek when the royals made a quick private visit to the church ahead of the services. Less than two hours later, they were back _ in different clothes _ for the Christmas service.     The Queen arrived first _ dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat _ in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind.     Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate_ now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off the shelves in Britain, wore an eggplant-colored coat and matching hat.     Among the other royals present was the queen's granddaughter, Zara Philips, who was joined by her new husband Mike Tindall, an English rugby player.     After the service, children lined up to give bouquets of flowers to the queen. Thanking each well-wisher, the queen then handed the bouquets to her granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.     Well-wisher Camilla Fitt, 71, said Charles told her that his father, Philip, was ""very determined"" to get well.     ""Charles said he is coming on,"" said Fitt.     The royal family then traveled back to the house for lunch, an integral part of their celebration.     Another key part of their Christmas festivities is the queen's annual message to the nation, which this year will focus on family and community.     The 85-year-old queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957. She writes the speeches herself, and the broadcasts mark the rare occasion on which the queen voices her own opinion without government consultation.     ___     Cassandra Vinograd can be reached at http://twitter.com/CassVinograd ",1125

Schumer says don’t look for her in a Super Bowl... (Associated Press)     FILE - In this April 17, 2018 file photo, Amy Schumer arrives at the world premiere of ""I Feel Pretty"" at the Westwood Village Theater in Los Angeles. Schumer says don’t look for her in a Super Bowl... (Associated Press)     Don't look for Amy Schumer in any Super Bowl LIII commercials this time around. She's sitting this one out as she stands with Colin Kaepernick and his take-a-knee protest against racism and police brutality.     The comedian and ""I Feel Pretty"" actress explained her stance at length Friday on Instagram, challenging white NFL players to kneel as well. Addressing them directly, she wrote: ""Otherwise how are you not complicit?""     Of her plan to steer clear of Super Bowl ads, she said: ""I personally told my reps I wouldn't do a Super Bowl commercial this year. I know it must sound like a privilege ass sacrifice but it's all I got.""     Diddy, Jessica Seinfeld and Christie Brinkley offered her support among more than 8,000 comments left on her post. It was not immediately clear whether she had been approached to appear in an ad during the big game.     In 2016, Schumer appeared with Seth Rogen in a political-themed campaign for Bud Light, ""Raise One to Right Now,"" during Super Bowl 50.     ""Hitting the nfl with the advertisers is the only way to hurt them,"" Schumer wrote of her ban. ""I know opposing the nfl is like opposing the nra. Very tough ..."" Passage 2: There's some exciting news in Hollywood: Amy Schumer is expecting her first child and she's expecting you to head to the polls this November. The comedian teased a big announcement on Instagram on Monday, while also directing her followers to go to Jessica Yellin's Instagram page. On her page, Yellin shared that Schumer is pregnant, as she promoted her #NewsNotNoise campaign. (When Bustle reached out for comment, Schumer's rep directed us to Yellin's Instagram page.)     Along with a photo of her and husband Chris Fischer's faces photoshopped on Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's bodies (who are also expecting their first child), Schumer wrote on Instagram:     ""About to announce some exciting news on @jessicayellin insta page. Please follow her for up to the minute #newsnotnoise she breaks down what’s really going on. She agreed to post a lil noise today for me! Follow her and VOTE!!""     Over on Yellin's page, she shared Schumer's picks for candidates in the upcoming midterm elections — but that's not all. In a series of videos on her Instagram Story, the former CNN Chief White House Correspondent explains,     ""We are 15 days out from the midterms and there is a lot going on ... I wanted to share some news from our community. Maybe it's noise, but it's happy noise... These are the recommendations of Amy Schumer, one of the most consistent and early supporters of #NewsNotNoise. Now, read all the way to the bottom. You'll see there's some news down there. Congratulations, Amy.""     As Yellin hinted, at the very bottom of the lengthy list, the note reads: ""I'm pregnant-Amy Schumer.""     Leave it to Schumer to double her pregnancy announcement as a political one. She likely knew the baby news would spark attention regardless, so she harnessed that platform to remind everyone about the midterms. Honestly, it's perfectly strategic. As for #NewsNotNoise, a quick look at Yellin's Instagram page explains what the movement is all about:     ""Political Jargon: Say What?! Lean Blue. Lean Red. Trump state. Blue wave. Early voting. Early returns. • What political jargon do you want explained? Post your question in comments. • I’ll pick a few and in the lead up to the election I’ll do a bunch of posts to help you better understand what it all means!""     Considering how passionate Schumer is about politics, it's not all that surprising that she's supporting an effort to educate people about what they need to know, versus what noise they can tune out. (Even if celebrity baby news might sometimes fall in the latter category, as Yellin said herself, it's ""happy noise."")     The Trainwreck star isn't one to back down from her beliefs. Earlier this month, Schumer was reportedly detained and arrested for protesting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, according to CNN.     Over the years, she's also been a vocal advocate for gun control, as well as other causes she cares about. In the last week alone, she's spoken out about supporting the transgender community, in the wake of the Trump Administration's memo reported on by the New York Times. She also supported Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest of the NFL by urging Maroon 5 to pull out of the Super Bowl Halftime Show as Rihanna reportedly did.     Suffice to say, Schumer commits to political causes. And that's exactly why tying her baby announcement to a voting announcement isn't the least bit surprising — but it is pretty great. ",1133
"Passage 1: LONDON (AP) — A Swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get pregnant.     FILE - In this April 4, 2012 photo made available by the University of Goteborg in Sweden, the Swedish research team practices before the operations to transplant wombs at the Sahlgrenska Hospital in... (Associated Press)     He would not say on Monday whether any of the women had succeeded. In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications.     The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos.     ""We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,"" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research.     Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth.     ""One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,"" he said.     There have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb — in Turkey and Saudi Arabia — but both failed to produce babies. Doctors in Britain and Hungary also are planning similar operations, but using wombs from women who had just died.     Brannstrom said any woman in the study who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy.     The transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one.     Some doctors said women who got pregnant with a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy.     ""There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby,"" said Dr. Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a gynecologist at Liverpool Women's Hospital.     In a study published last week, Brannstrom and colleagues described the procedures used to transplant the nine wombs and said there were ""mild rejection episodes"" in four patients.     He said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.     Other experts called it a promising step but said it would be crucial that babies get enough nutrients from the mother's blood supply.     ""We really don't know if the blood flow to the uterus will increase and adapt in the same way,"" as in a regular pregnancy, said Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital in London.     ""It is a good sign they have done the (embryo) transfers,"" Khalaf said. ""But a live birth will be the best validation that this works."" Passage 2: Swedish medical team hoping for world first as women born without uterus or who lost it to cancer get embryo transfers     Four of nine women given pioneering womb transplants in Sweden have now also had embryos transferred, the pioneering Swedish doctor treating them has said.     Dr Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg University, said his team had embarked on a programme of embryo transfer for the women, who were either born without a womb or lost it as a result of cancer. All have ovaries so were able to produce eggs that were fertilised using IVF.     Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the nine women might succeed in giving birth, which would be a world first. Other womb transplants have taken place in Saudi Arabia and Turkey but no recipients have yet managed to have a child. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it failed after two months.     ""We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,"" said Brannstrom. He would not say whether any of the women were pregnant at the moment. In a study published last week, the team said that there were ""mild rejection episodes"" in four women who received donated wombs. Two patients had to have the uterus removed because of complications.     Brannstrom's technique is controversial because he is accepting wombs donated by living women, who are relatives or friends of his patients. Elsewhere, wombs from dead donors have been used.     Dr Richard Smith, head of the UK charity Womb Transplant UK, which is trying to raise money to carry out transplants here, has said that large chunks of blood vessels had to be removed from the donor as well as the uterus itself, raising the risks of the operation for the donor. In the UK, there would be ethical questions because the operation is not a life-saving procedure, he said.     The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ. They will also have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy.     Dr Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby.""     Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. ",1201
"Passage 1: Shawn Inglima for New York Daily News Rasheen Rose died at a Queens state development care facility while being restrained by workers, his family's attorney said.     A Harlem woman has been hit with a whopping $11.67 million medical bill from a state institution she says killed her mentally disabled brother.     Shaniece Luke, 39, said her jaw dropped when she received the bill from the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities.     “I thought it was ridiculous. I couldn’t believe it!” Luke told the Daily News Wednesday.     She and her lawyers contend the astronomical bill is in retaliation for filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency and the Queens developmental center where her brother, Rasheen Rose, died in 2012.     “It has to be,” Luke said. “But they were the ones who killed my brother.”     The notarized bill, sent to Rose’s estate in March, was for paid Medicaid assistance from August 2002 up to Rose’s death. The state agency is demanding to be paid the staggering amount if Luke prevails in her suit and is awarded punitive damages.     New York Daily News Shaneice Luke received this bill for $11,672,701.66.     “The number is mind-boggling. And it becomes more egregious because Rasheen died at the hand of one of their workers,” Luke’s attorney, Aaron DePass, told The News.     Rose, 33, who was born with severe autism and was never able to communicate verbally, died on Aug. 6, 2012 at the Bernard Fineson Developmental Center in Queens Village.     The city medical examiner ruled the death a homicide in December 2012, citing evidence that Rose died from injuries caused by being physically restrained.     Luke’s attorneys said their investigation showed that the 5-foot-7, 175-pound Rose was restrained in a dangerous prone position for up to 30 minutes by three staffers, including a 275-pound worker who sat on him.     “He was basically crushed to death,” DePass said.     Mike Groll/AP Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called it 'retaliation' and 'an outrage' to send the bill to someone who lost a loved one from abusive care.     Robert Santoriella, Depass’ law partner, said at least nine other staff members, including two doctors and two nurses, were in the room when Rose became unresponsive.     Citing the pending litigation, the office for People with Developmental Disabilities declined comment.     Attorney Ilann Maazel said others who have filed lawsuits on behalf of loved ones who have died in state care have received similar bills.     Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg (D-Long Island) said the bills are clearly meant as retaliation.     “It’s an outrage,” he said.     With News Wire Services Passage 2: ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Two years after a 33-year-old mentally disabled man died at a state institution in Queens, and one year after his sister filed a lawsuit accusing the staff of killing him, New York officials have sent her an $11.67 million bill.     The claim against Rasheen Rose's estate cited his total Medicaid assistance from Aug. 6, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2012, the day he died.     A spokeswoman for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, which runs the center, said Wednesday officials were following federal Medicaid obligations in seeking reimbursement.     ""Not doing so would be a violation and could put federal Medicaid funding at risk,"" spokeswoman Jennifer O'Sullivan said.     Medicaid, a state and federal program for the poor, doesn't typically demand reimbursement.     But Ilann Maazel, an attorney who has filed lawsuits against the state after others died in state care, said other claim notices recently have been sent to families suing.     ""This is something new we're seeing ... and it's problematic,"" he said Wednesday.     Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, an advocate for the disabled whose adult son gets state-funded residential care, called it ""retaliation"" and ""an outrage"" to send the bill to someone who lost a loved one from abusive care. ""They're going to punish these people because they brought it to view of justice,"" he said.     The New York medical examiner concluded Rose's death was a homicide and that he ""became unresponsive"" while being restrained at Fineson Developmental Center. The Queens district attorney's office said it wasn't notified about the death until that homicide ruling was made four months later. Investigators found no criminal conduct but have left the case open, spokesman Kevin Ryan said.     Shaneice Luke, Rose's sister, is seeking unspecified punitive and other damages in a federal lawsuit. She alleges that at least three staff threw Rose to the ground and one sat on him, while other staff stood by. She also alleges a history of abuse at Fineson and failure by supervisors and the state to address that or to train staff properly.     ""Rasheen Rose did not receive care remotely associated with the amount of money collected by OPWDD for Rasheen Rose over the 10-year period,"" attorney Aaron DePass replied to the state agency on Luke's behalf. Because he was actually killed by his supposed caregivers, ""it is clear that the quality of care he received does not warrant any payment for services whatsoever,"" he wrote.     In federal court papers, all seven staff named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing, saying they acted within their professional judgment. The state attorney general and private lawyers are defending them.     Two years ago, a congressional oversight committee reported that New York's residential centers for the developmentally disabled like Fineson, which have largely emptied in an ongoing shift to community-based programs and group homes, cost Medicaid about $1.9 million a year for each patient.     The Cuomo administration last year announced plans to close four developmental centers over four years, including Fineson in 2017. ",1223
"Passage 1: Owen Labrie, the former St. Paul’s School student convicted last year of having sex with an underclassman at the elite Granite State boarding school, will soon be set free on bail -- again.     After two months in jail, a New Hampshire judge ruled today the 20-year-old can post bail while he awaits his appeal. He will be put on a GPS monitor.     Labrie was convicted last October of sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and prohibited use of a computer and released on $15,000 bail while he appealed on the conditions that he live at his mother’s Tunbridge, Vermont, home and abide by a 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. curfew.     On Feb. 29, a reporter tweeted about an encounter with him on a train in Cambridge, where he said he was visiting his girlfriend at Harvard University.     Those tweets led to an investigation in which police found that he had violated his curfew at least 12 times, officials said. His bail was then revoked.     His lawyer successfully argued for his release again today before Merrimack County Judge Larry Smukler.     Develioping ... Passage 2: A prep school graduate convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old freshman girl as part of a game of sexual conquest called Senior Salute will again be free pending appeal.         Owen Labrie had been free after his conviction last year, but a judge revoked his bail in March after he admitted violating his curfew. He appealed to the state Supreme Court, which last week returned the matter to the trial court.         Labrie's attorney argued at a hearing on Monday that being locked up for two months has been a ""life-changing"" experience for him and he'll comply with any additional conditions.         A state prosecutor countered that the only thing that's changed is Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont, doesn't like being in jail.         A Merrimack County Superior Court judge said he'll allow Labrie to be released with electronic monitoring via GPS. The earliest Labrie would be released is Wednesday, and the latest is Friday, prosecutors said.         Labrie was arrested in 2014 days after graduating from St. Paul's School in Concord. He was 18 years old then and is 20 now.         During his trial, he testified that he and the girl had consensual sexual contact, but he denied having sexual intercourse with her. He acknowledged he had boasted to the contrary to friends, in profane emails and social media posts that were shared with the jury.         The encounter between Labrie and the girl took place in a nearly deserted building whose roof had a panoramic view of the school's 2,000-acre campus. After a brief time on the roof, the girl testified, Labrie led her to a dark mechanical room, they consensually kissed and touched each other and he raped her.         Labrie had been bound for Harvard University and had planned to take divinity classes before his arrest put everything on hold. He wept upon hearing the verdict last year. Passage 3: CONCORD — St. Paul’s School sex-trial convict Owen Labrie won a second chance at freedom Monday, when a judge said he can be released on bail while his lawyers challenge his conviction.Superior Court Judge Larry Smukler said Labrie, 20, can get out of jail once he is fitted with an electronic monitor that is tracked via GPS. Merrimack County officials said that will likely take place between Wednesday and Friday.“It’s clear that Mr. Labrie did break the trust of the court,” Smukler said. He added that he’s not 100 percent sure that Labrie will now comply, thus the need for monitoring.“To paraphrase another person, trust but verify,” the judge said.Labrie appeared at a Merrimack County Superior Court hearing in an orange prison jumpsuit with his ankles shackled. He was handcuffed and returned to jail once the hearing ended.Labrie’s lawyer Jaye Rancourt said Labrie and his family are happy with the decision. During a Monday afternoon hearing, she said the prep-school graduate will abide by the rules, and said her client had suffered sadness, fear, nervousness and boredom in his two months at jail.He moved out of administrative segregation just in the past week, she said.“He understands why he’s there. He will abide by the conditions,” she said. Those include residing at his mother’s Vermont home between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. Rancourt said Labrie will have a job working in manual labor.“I think a regular person wouldn’t have had his bail revoked,” Rancourt said when asked about Labrie’s treatment. “I think he’s been under intense scrutiny and probably treated more strictly than some.”His lawyers admit he violated bail several times earlier this year. The case went public when a reporter wrote about seeing him in March on an MBTA train, where Labrie said he was visiting his girlfriend in college.“Our concern is the safety of the community,” said Merrimack County prosecutor Catherine Ruffles. She noted Labrie was visiting a college campus and said he had not meaningfully participated in a psycho-sexual assessment.Without the assessment, Ruffles said she can’t determine the level of risk for the community.Meanwhile, the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence said the decision sends the wrong message to victims of crime.“When there is a lack of respect for our court system, people should be held accountable. When offenders do not face consequences for their actions, victims are the ones that pay the price,” spokesman Maureen McDonald said in an email.Labrie was released on bail after his conviction last summer on three misdemeanor sexual assault charges, a misdemeanor child endangerment charge and a felony unlawful computer use charge.He has appealed the conviction, but he is also seeking a new trial, claiming ineffective counsel.mhayward@unionleader.com..

"Passage 1: LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Eleven-year old Yonatan Daniel Aguilar weighed just 34 pounds when he was found dead, wrapped in a blanket, lying on a hard tile floor inside a bedroom closet in this small Echo Park home. Sources close to the investigation told us the closet was so small, Yonotan couldn’t stretch out his legs.     According to juvenile court documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times the boy, who had been diagnosed with autism, was often locked away in closets for three years and sedated with liquid sleep medication, apparently to keep him quiet.     Investigators believe even the boy’s step father who lived in the home didn’t know the boy was living there.     CBSLA’s Randy Paige asked Department of Children and Family Services Director Philip Browning on Thursday: “How could someone live in that house and not know a little boy was there?”     “Well, I think that’s what’s so puzzling,” Browning said.     Previous Stories: Yonaton Aguilar Case     Four years before, when reports of possible child abuse were reported, Yonotan’s mother Veronica Aguilar, who was a volunteer at the school and attended parenting classes, was able to convince his teachers, counselors, coaches, medical staff and social workers that her son was safe in her home. Then, when Yonotan stopped showing up for school, his mother told people he had gone to live in an institution in Mexico.     According to the court documents, Yonotan’s three siblings and his mother were the only ones in on the secret.     “I think there was a façade that occurred that took everyone in, including law enforcement,” Browning said.     According to the Los Angeles Times, redacted court records indicate Aguilar effectively disappeared in 2012 after he was seen at school with a black eye and school officials said he was hoarding food.     Aguilar told the boy’s therapist that Yonatan lived with his maternal grandmother until age 3, and he was likely deprived of food during that time and developed the habit of hoarding food, according to the records cited by The Times.     Soon after, the boy was pulled out of school and wasn’t seen as the family repeatedly moved.     Officials with county Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) — which had responded to six reports of possible abuse or neglect involving the family from 2009 to 2012 and marked the boy’s risk of abuse “high” four times — had no further contact, according to The Times.     After claiming allegations of abuse were inconclusive or unfounded, social workers never formally opened a case, according to the records cited by the paper.     At one point, Aguilar told Jose Pinzon, the boy’s stepfather, that he had died. Pinzon had been told previously by Aguilar that she sent Yonatan to Mexico to live with family, and he hadn’t seen the boy in years, The Times reported.     Aguilar led Pinzon to a closet in their home on Aug. 22 and found Yonatan’s emaciated body described as being covered in pressure sores from the tile floor. There was foam in his nose and medicinal cups of pink and red liquid near his balding body, according to the records obtained by The Times.     Pinzon then ran to a 7-Eleven and called police.     Aguilar, 39, is now charged with murder and child abuse causing death. She remains jailed on $2 million bail.

Passage 3: LOS ANGELES, CA – An 11-year-old boy who was found dead in his family’s home was kept hidden in a closet for years, according to court documents the Los Angeles Times obtained.     Three years ago, Yonatan Daniel Aguilar stopped going to school and seemingly disappeared. When people asked his mother Veronica Aguilar, 39, where he was, she told them he was in an institution in Mexico, court records say.     But that wasn’t the case. Aguilar was keeping Yonatan in a locked bedroom closet, sedating him with liquid sleep medication to keep him quiet.     According to the Los Angeles Times, investigators say the boy was so well-hidden that even his stepfather, Jose Pinzon, who lived in the home didn’t know he was there.     On August 22, 2016, Aguilar told Pinzon Yonatan had died, and that’s when she led him to the closet where Yonatan had been kept. Authorities say he weighed only 34 pounds, and the closet was so small he couldn’t even stretch his legs out. His body was covered in pressure sores from the tile floors, and there were medicinal cups of pink and red liquid near him.     Pinzon then ran to a nearby 7-Eleven and called police.     Aguilar’s other three children were the only people who knew Yonatan was in the closet. In fact, two of them slept in the bed right outside the closet door, but Aguilar had forbidden them from telling anyone.     Aguilar, 39, is charged with murder and child abuse causing death; she is in jail on a $2 million bail. ",1254

(Associated Press)     Policemen chase after protesters following a rally against a once-planned Quran burning in the U.S., in Kabul, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 15, 2010. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das) (Associated Press)     The topic of Quran burning has stirred outrage among millions of Muslims and others worldwide after a small American church in Florida threatened to destroy the holy book to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Although that church backed down, several copycat burnings were posted on the Internet and broadcast in the Muslim world.     But Afghan police have claimed that the Taliban are deliberately using the anger to turn the rallies into anti-government protests ahead of this week's parliamentary elections.     Up to 800 protesters gathered at a square on the outskirts of the capital, Kabul, chanting ""Death to America"" and listening to fiery speeches from Muslim clerics demanding the ouster of the Afghan government and calling for foreign troops to leave the country.     The protesters burned tires and hurled stones at police officers, who responded with assault rifle firing into the air.     Khalil Dastyar, deputy Kabul police chief, said the protest started peacefully, but the crowd eventually charged the police.     ""Police opened fire to stop the charge,"" he added, claiming the protesters fired toward the police with pistols.     An Associated Press reporter saw at least three wounded protesters, hit by police batons. Hospital officials said two other people had gunshot wounds.     Cleric Enayat Ullah said at the protest that he was ""ready to sacrifice my life for the Quran, we came here to defend our holy book.""     Police officer Mohammad Fahim said he doubted that the Quran burning was the main aim of the protest.     ""They say they are protesting because of the Quran, but what I saw among the protesters were our enemies, the Taliban,"" he said. ""They want to sabotage the security ahead of this week's elections.""     Parliamentary elections take place Saturday. The Taliban has vowed to target polling stations and has warned Afghans not to participate in what it calls a sham vote.     Similar protests have been mounted across this Muslim nation in recent days. Hundreds protested on Sunday, and two people were killed in that unrest. In another protest by thousands on Friday, 11 people were injured.     ___     Associated Press writer Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this report. Passage 2: KABUL (Reuters) – Police fired into the air to disperse thousands of anti-American protesters in Afghanistan's capital Wednesday, witnesses and police said, with one person killed and at least five wounded.     Demonstrators chanted ""Death to America,"" ""Death to Christians,"" and ""Death to Karzai,"" the latter referring to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, in the biggest protests since unrest erupted last week over plans by a U.S. pastor to burn the Koran.     ""There are more than 10,000 of the demonstrators and some of them are waving the Taliban flag,"" police officer Mohammad Usman.     The protests come three days before a parliamentary election which the Taliban have vowed to disrupt. The election is a key test of stability in Afghanistan before U.S. President Barack Obama conducts a war strategy review in December.     They follow three days of protests at the weekend over plans by an obscure U.S. pastor, which he later abandoned, to burn copies of the Koran to mark the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, hijacked airliner attacks on the United States.     Three people were killed in those protests. Observers including the top U.N. diplomat in Afghanistan had warned the Taliban may try to exploit the Koran-burning protests.     A police source later said one person had been killed and five wounded, and that the toll could rise. The protests were the Reuters television pictures showed protesters waving large white flags, the symbol used by Taliban supporters.     A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the hardline Islamist group was aware of the protests but had no role in them.     ""People may have raised the Taliban flags to show their sentiment and sympathy for the Taliban,"" Mujahid told Reuters from an undisclosed location.     At the Pul-e-Kandahari, or Kandahar bridge in Kabul, police were ordered to advance toward one group of hundreds of protesters who were throwing stones and shouting ""Death to American slaves"" at police.     Police were seen firing into the air and dragging away several protesters. At one point, volleys of gunfire could be heard. The protesters scattered, some sheltering in nearby houses in the mainly ethnic Pashtun and Tajik area of Kabul.     The protesters earlier gathered in the west of the capital, burning tires and blocking a main highway link to the south. Thick black smoke rose above the area and police kept journalists several hundred meters back.     Reuters witnesses at the scene saw two unconscious people, covered in blood, being carried away suffering what appeared to be gunshot wounds.

[RECOMMENDED: Tourist run over on beach, killed | Shark in pond eludes trappers]     Sarah Anne Markham was arrested Tuesday on a charge of child neglect.     According to Casselberry police, a pediatrician told Markham that her baby needed to be admitted to Florida Hospital South for treatment because the child was dehydrated and was losing weight.     Markham, however, went home and would not answer when officers knocked at her door.     Police used a locksmith to enter the apartment and interviewed Markham, who said she wanted to get a second opinion about her child, according to a police report.         Police said Markham told them that she wanted to pursue a religious-based treatment and did not believe that her baby was dehydrated because the child was having bowel movements.     Markham said she had contacted a ""natural"" or ""vegan"" doctor but was unable to provide any information about him, other than a name.     [SEE THESE? Notable deaths of 2014 | Michael Jackson: A life in pics | Celebs & pets]     Markham said she did not give the formula/medicine that the doctor provided because she did not agree with the ingredients, which she said came from animals, the police report stated.     Markham said she purchased organic soy formula, and when asked if she confirmed with a doctor if it was safe for a newborn, she said that if Whole Foods Market sells it then the formula doesn't contain any animal parts and, therefore, must be safe, according to police.     She then said she would take the child to Florida Hospital South but only because she was being forced to, according to authorities. About an hour later, however, she was still at home and was placed under arrest.     While en route to jail, according to police, Markham had a carefree attitude, even though she was told that she was not going to be allowed to see her child until a court hearing.     The baby was taken to Florida Hospital South for treatment and was placed into state custody.     Markham later bonded out of jail.

A vegan mother whose newborn son was taken from her several months ago after he began losing weight has regained custody of the child.     On Wednesday, a Seminole County, Florida, judge told Sarah Markham that she would get custody of her son Caleb, with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days.     Markham was arrested in June when her son was less than 2 weeks old. He had lost 10 percent of his body weight. A doctor said Caleb was failing to thrive and told Markham to take her child to a hospital.     Rather than taking the boy to the hospital, Markham wanted to try supplementing breast milk with vegan formula.     >> Read more trending stories     ""There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect – there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,"" said Bo Markham, Caleb's grandfather.
